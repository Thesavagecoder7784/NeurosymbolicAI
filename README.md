## Introduction
Neurosymbolic AI merges the learning capabilities of neural networks with the logic and reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. This approach aims to improve both the performance and interpretability of AI models. This repository provides a collection of architectures, research papers, and explanations to help you get started with neurosymbolic AI.

## Examples
### 1. Neurosymbolic AI Mocktail recommendation system
#### Neural part: 
- A neural network model is trained using the dataset to learn patterns and relationships between ingredients and flavor profiles.
- The model is designed to predict the best mocktail recipes based on user preferences.

#### Symbolic part:
- The system presents predefined flavor combination options to the user.
- The symbolic logic is used to understand the effects of combining different ingredients. This logic ensures that the mocktail prediction doesn't include a combination of ingredients that will not go together.

#### Integration of both
In this architecture, the model uses symbolic logic to filter out predictions generated by the model and present the best ones to the user. The symbolic component ensures that the recommendations align with predefined flavor profiles and user preferences, while the neural network leverages data to optimize the predictions. This combination results in a robust system that provides personalized and refined recommendations to the user.

## Architectures
