## Introduction
Neurosymbolic AI merges the learning capabilities of neural networks with the logic and reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. This approach aims to improve both the performance and interpretability of AI models. This repository provides a collection of architectures, research papers, and explanations to help you get started with neurosymbolic AI.

## Architectures
### Neural-Symbolic Integration
In this section, we explore architectures that tightly integrate neural networks with symbolic reasoning systems. This includes models that use neural networks to process raw data and symbolic systems to reason and make decisions based on high-level abstractions.

### Neuro-Symbolic Programming
Neuro-symbolic programming combines neural networks with programming languages, enabling the use of symbolic logic within neural architectures. This section covers models that incorporate programming constructs to enhance neural network capabilities.

### Hybrid Approaches
Hybrid approaches aim to leverage the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning by combining them in a modular fashion. This section includes models that use neural networks for perception and symbolic reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving.
